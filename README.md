# Chat-with-website-using-RAG-Pipeline
## Overview  
This project demonstrates the development of an AI-driven chatbot system that extracts, processes, and retrieves relevant information from websites to answer user queries intelligently. By integrating web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning, the chatbot delivers accurate and context-aware responses.  

## Features  
1. **Web Scraping**  
   - Utilizes `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to extract raw text from specified websites.  
   - Efficiently handles multiple URLs and aggregates data into a single text source.  

2. **Text Segmentation**  
   - Implements `nltk`'s Punkt tokenizer to split the raw text into manageable sentence chunks.  
   - Groups sentences for optimized processing and response generation.  

3. **Text Embedding**  
   - Leverages `SentenceTransformers` to generate dense vector representations of text chunks.  
   - Supports semantic similarity searches for efficient information retrieval.  

4. **Embedding Store with FAISS**  
   - Stores embeddings in a FAISS index for scalable and quick similarity searches.  
   - Handles embedding addition, saving, loading, and querying seamlessly.  

5. **Query Processing**  
   - Converts user queries into embeddings for matching against stored text chunks.  
   - Retrieves the most relevant information based on semantic similarity.  

6. **Response Generation**  
   - Uses a `transformers` pipeline with GPT-2 to craft natural language responses based on retrieved text.  

## Applications  
- Website-based AI chatbots.  
- Knowledge retrieval systems for FAQs, customer support, and educational content.  
- Semantic search tools for large text datasets.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, NLTK, SentenceTransformers, FAISS, Transformers, BeautifulSoup  
- **Machine Learning Models:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, GPT-2  
- **Tools:** FAISS for embedding indexing, Hugging Face Transformers  

## How It Works  
1. **Web Scraping:** The project begins by crawling and extracting textual content from a website.  
2. **Text Segmentation:** The extracted text is tokenized into smaller chunks for efficient processing.  
3. **Embedding Generation:** These chunks are converted into embeddings that capture their semantic meaning.  
4. **Indexing with FAISS:** The embeddings are stored in a FAISS index to enable quick similarity searches.  
5. **Query Matching:** User queries are processed into embeddings, matched with stored data, and relevant chunks are retrieved.  
6. **Response Crafting:** The retrieved chunks are fed to a language model to generate a coherent and natural response.  

## Outcomes  
This project provides a modular framework for building scalable and intelligent chatbots capable of understanding and responding to queries based on real-time web content.
